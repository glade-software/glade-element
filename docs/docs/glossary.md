### Document

A **document** in Glade is _not_ synonymous with an HTML document. A Glade **document** instead refers to an entire DOM structure that is inside a glade-element tag.

### Referent

A **referent** is a given portion of DOM that an annotation refers to. Currently Glade referents are just DOM nodes that are inside a glade-element tag, and are not nested any deeper than that.

### Annotation

An **annotation** is a piece of content a user creates in the Glade GUI, which is attached to a specific **referent**.
