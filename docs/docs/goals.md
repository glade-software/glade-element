The web is a collection of disparate and discrete documents, where comments are not a first party citizen. We see the potential for the web as more.

We envision a world where the platform has annotation as a first-class citizen, where anyone could highlight a portion of the web and add their commentary in any HTML5+ medium.

Annotations are just more online content. They can be any approved format of online document, provided the format is deemed safe and supported.

The first annotation type supported is pure text, but it is easy to see how the annotation editor could enable other types of media uploads.

The vision is to enable users to see and create annotations on every webpage, but we'd love to start with just yours <3
