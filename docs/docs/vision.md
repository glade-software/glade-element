The web is a collection of disparate and discrete documents, where comments are not a first-class citizen. We see the potential for the web to be more than that.

We envision a world where the web platform has annotation as a first-class citizen, where anyone could highlight a portion of the web and add their commentary in any HTML5+ medium.

Annotations are just more online content. They can be any approved format of online document, provided the format is deemed safe and supported.

Annotations are [created](creating-annotations) using **Markdown** and can also render embeds from all known [oembed providers](https://oembed.com/providers.json)!

The vision is to enable users to see and create annotations on every webpage, but we'd love to start with just yours <3
