# &lt;glade-annotateable>

`<glade-annotateable>` allows your audience to annotate any of your content!

## Configure with attributes

<section class="columns">
  <div>

`<glade-annotateable>` can be configured with plain HTML. Just wrap your content with the tag, and give it a `slug` for use as a unique identifier for the content you wrapped.

```html
<glade-annotateable slug="demo">
  <p>this content is annotateable</p>
  <p>this is a paragraph inside a glade-annotateable element</p>
</glade-annotateable>
```

<glade-annotateable slug="html">
  <p>this content is annotateable</p>
  <p>this is a paragraph inside a glade-annotateable element</p>
</glade-annotateable>

  </div>
</section>
