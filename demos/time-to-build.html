        Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic,
        despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional
        effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but
        it&#8217;s not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or
        another, on one government or another. But the harsh reality is that it
        all failed &#8212; no Western country, or state, or city was prepared
        &#8212; and despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many
        people within these institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your
        favorite political opponent or your home nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But
        the other part of the problem is what we didn&#8217;t *do* in advance,
        and what we&#8217;re failing to do now. And that is a failure of action,
        and specifically our widespread inability to *build*.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see this today with the things we urgently need but don&#8217;t have.
        We don&#8217;t have enough coronavirus tests, or test materials &#8212;
        including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents. We don&#8217;t
        have enough ventilators, negative pressure rooms, and ICU beds. And we
        don&#8217;t have enough surgical masks, eye shields, and medical gowns
        &#8212; as I write this, New York City has put out a desperate call for
        rain ponchos to be used as medical gowns. Rain ponchos! In 2020! In
        America!
      </p>
      <p>
        We also don&#8217;t have therapies or a vaccine &#8212; despite, again,
        years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses. Our scientists
        will hopefully invent therapies and a vaccine, but then we may not have
        the manufacturing factories required to scale their production. And even
        then, we&#8217;ll see if we can deploy therapies or a vaccine fast
        enough to matter &#8212; it took scientists 5 years to get regulatory
        testing approval for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourge&#8217;s
        2014 outbreak, at the cost of many lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the U.S., we don&#8217;t even have the ability to get federal bailout
        money to the people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of
        laid off workers and their families, and many millions of small
        businesses, are in serious trouble *right now*, and we have no direct
        method to transfer them money without potentially disastrous delays. A
        government that collects money from all its citizens and businesses each
        year has never built a system to distribute money to us when it&#8217;s
        needed most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial
        conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and
        vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We
        could have these things but we chose not to &#8212; specifically we
        chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make
        these things. We chose not to *build*.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don&#8217;t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with
        the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in
        healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and
        specifically throughout American life.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We
        can&#8217;t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging
        economic potential &#8212; which results in crazily skyrocketing housing
        prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for
        regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also
        can&#8217;t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of
        HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Westworld&#8221; wanted to portray the American city
        of the future, they didn&#8217;t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or
        Austin &#8212; they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming
        skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities
        at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?
      </p>
      <p>
        You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the
        capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18
        year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in
        the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn&#8217;t that
        the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger
        number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major
        innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the
        1960s; we&#8217;ve been doing education research that&#8217;s never
        reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot
        more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one
        tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard
        deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why
        haven&#8217;t we built systems to match every young learner with an
        older tutor to dramatically improve student success?
      </p>
      <p>
        You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American
        manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much
        manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We
        know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous
        number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and
        operate those factories. We know &#8212; and we&#8217;re experiencing
        right now! &#8212; the strategic problem of relying on offshore
        manufacturing of key goods. Why aren&#8217;t we building Elon
        Musk&#8217;s &#8220;alien dreadnoughts&#8221; &#8212; giant, gleaming,
        state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product,
        at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost &#8212; all
        throughout our country?
      </p>
      <p>
        You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where
        are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains,
        the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money
        to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out
        incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just
        passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the
        problem capitalism? I&#8217;m with Nicholas Stern when he says that
        capitalism is how we take care of people we don&#8217;t know &#8212; all
        of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime
        stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor
        and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence?
        Clearly not, or we wouldn&#8217;t have the homes and skyscrapers,
        schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that
        we already have.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is
        inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these
        things. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies
        to build these things, even if incumbents don&#8217;t like it, even if
        only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is
        will. We need to build these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from
        ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building.
      </p>
      <p>
        The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The
        right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces
        that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The
        right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture,
        ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly
        buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of
        time, even more investor-friendly) innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#8217;s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political
        support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new
        industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in
        many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model!
        Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better
        schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop
        trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the
        public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great
        public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their
        intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an
        insult, take it as a challenge &#8212; build new things and show the
        results!
      </p>
      <p>
        Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and
        effective &#8212; how about starting with the VA? When the next
        coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like
        Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can&#8217;t 100,000 or 1
        million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn&#8217;t regulators
        and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by
        building &#8212; energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical
        power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new
        zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let&#8217;s build those. Maybe we can
        start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The
        things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly
        in price. The things we don&#8217;t, like housing, schools, and
        hospitals, skyrocket in price. What&#8217;s the American dream? The
        opportunity to have a home of your own, and a family you can provide
        for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for housing,
        education, and healthcare, to make sure that every American can realize
        the dream, and the only way to do that is to build.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building isn&#8217;t easy, or we&#8217;d already be doing all this. We
        need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our
        entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of
        our society. And we need to demand more from one another. We&#8217;re
        all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the
        question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or
        helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or
        taking care of people who are building? If the work you&#8217;re doing
        isn&#8217;t either leading to something being built or taking care of
        people directly, we&#8217;ve failed you, and we need to get you into a
        position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building.
        There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems
        &#8212; we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we
        have, and on building the answers to those problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here&#8217;s a modest
        proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build,
        conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There&#8217;s an
        excellent chance I&#8217;ll agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building.
        Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and
        factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and
        uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that
        are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being.
        There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we
        want for our own children and grandchildren, and that&#8217;s to build.
