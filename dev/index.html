  <glade-annotateable slug="restless">
    <p>Check my common thread count</p>
    <p>I'll put this shit to bed now</p>
    <p>lying on my back but I'll get this off my chest wow</p>
    <p>I'm tired of the rest and the rest are tired</p>
    <p>but between me and the rest im the less admired</p>
    <p>after all theres no rest for the wicked</p>
    <p>and theres adderall for the rest if you isn't</p>
    <p>poor grammar in the interest of rhyme</p>
    <p>if you pay attention grow interest with time</p>
    <p>if you have a deficit pay me no mind</p>
    <p>so binary, restful or restless</p>
    <p>shouts the proxy, not first to address this</p>
    <p>404 if you didn’t get the message</p>
    <p>restful just like the measures</p>
    <p>restless from the atmosphere</p>
    <p>that's the pressure</p>
    <p>so many bars, I didn’t under tongue it</p>
    <p>I'm off wax, on wax, I just have to blunt it</p>
    <p>coding with no coating</p>
    <p>it's wack that this shit's still funded</p>
    <p>damn, I just let the meds talk</p>
    <p>more sus than a susan with headshots</p>
    <p>more buck than the bloody med shots</p>
    <p>more tune for my fucking headtop</p>
